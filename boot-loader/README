REPLACEMENT COBALT Qube2/RaQ2 BOOT LOADER
=========================================

See the file INSTALL for installation instructions.

FEATURES
--------

* Will boot from any primary Linux partition containing an EXT2/3 filing
  system. The boot filing system is no longer required to be a formatted as an
  EXT2 revision 0 filing system. Will also boot from a whole device.

* The maximum size of kernel that can be booted is only constrained by
  available memory. A 16MB unit will be able to boot a 7MB uncompressed
  kernel (the limit is less for a compressed kernel, probably around 5MB).

* Support for booting from EXT2 formatted CDROMs.

LIMITATIONS
-----------

* The boot loader currently unconditionally outputs boot messages over the
  serial port. This would probably upset attached modems etc.

* Will not currently boot from logical (extended) partitions.

* Network booting is currently not supported. To use the factory restore CD to
  restore your unit you will have to restore the original boot loader first.
  There is obviously a risk involved in doing this as it requires
  reprogramming the Flash.
