REPLACEMENT COBALT Qube2/RaQ2 BOOT LOADER SHELL
===============================================

The replacement boot loader implements a command shell that can be entered by
pressing CTRL-C or SPACE on a serial terminal connected to the serial port on
the unit, just before the unit starts the boot process (115200 baud).

The shell can also be entered from the LCD boot menu (hold "ENTER" and
"SELECT" whilst booting to force the boot menu to appear).

*note*

	By default the boot menu will appear on every boot. This behaviour can be
	changed using the 'boot' command detailed below.

If the boot process is not intercepted the unit will boot using the default
boot script. If this has not been changed below) the "Disk (hda)" option will
be used which executes the internal script :-

	mount
	-script /boot/default.colo
	load /boot/vmlinux.gz
	execute

An example /boot/default.colo might look like this (just an example) :-

	# load default kernel from hda2 root volume
	mount hda2
	load /boot/vmlinux.gz
	lcd "Unzipping kernel"
	execute root=/dev/{mounted-volume} console=ttyS0,{console-speed}

GENERAL
-------

The default radix for all numbers used in the shell is 16 (hexadecimal).
Values are interpreted as decimal values if they are suffixed with a 't').

The shell implements a command history which can be stepped through using the
UP and DOWN cursor keys on the terminal (assuming the keymap is set
correctly). TAB completes the current partial command from the command
history.

The PAGE-UP/PAGE-DOWN keys are mapped to forward/backward word for terminals
that support these keys.

Variable names enclosed in '{' and '}' are replaced with the variable's value.

If a line begins with a '#' the whole line is ignored. This can be used to
include comments in script files.

If a command begins with a '-' an executing script will not be aborted even if
the command fails.

Some commands that can take a long time to execute can be aborted by hitting
CTRL-C or the SPACE key.

VARIABLES
---------

The following variables are set by the shell when appropriate :-

console-speed			Set to the boot loader baud rate (currently 115200).
mounted-volume			Set to the name of the currently mounted volume (eg hda2).
dhcp-next-server		'next server' returned by DHCP server.
dhcp-boot-file			'boot file' returned by DHCP server.
dhcp-root-path			'root path' returned by DHCP server.
initrd-start			Start address of initrd image (in hex).
initrd-end				First address after initrd image (in hex).
initrd-size				Size of initrd image (in hex).

See the 'variable' command for more information.

SHELL COMMANDS
--------------

mount [partition]
-----------------

Mounts the selected partition as an EXT2/3 file system. The partition argument
is a Linux style device name (eg "hda2"). If omitted the first partition
marked as a bootable Linux partition will be mounted. If no partition is
marked bootable the first Linux partition will be mounted.

ls [path ...]
-------------

List the directory information for the specified path(s). If no paths are
specified the current directory is listed.

cd [path]
---------

Change directory to the specified path. If no path is specified the current
directory path is displayed.

load path [path]
----------------

Load the specified file into memory. An optional second file can be specified
that will also be loaded and used as an 'initrd' image.

script
------

Runs the image that is loaded into memory as a boot shell script. A script
will only be run if it begins with the text "#:CoLo:#".

Execution of a script will be aborted if a command fails, unless the failing
command is preceded by a '-'.

execute [arguments ...]
-----------------------

Starts executing the ELF image that is in memory. If the image is compressed
with 'gzip' it will be uncompressed automatically.

To enable the kernel to load an initrd image you should pass a command line of
the form 'initrd={initrd-size}@{initrd-start}'.

Any arguments given will be passed to the executed program (the kernel needs
to be patched for this to work). The passed 'argc' value is the argument count
ORed with the KSEG0 address of the top of memory (for compatibility with the
kernel).

reboot
------

Reboots the unit.

unzip
-----

Decompresses the 'gzip' compressed image in memory.

md5sum [address size]
---------------------

If used with no arguments the MD5 hash of the current image in memory is
displayed, otherwise the MD5 hash of the specified memory block is displayed.

download [base-address]
-----------------------

Load an S-record image sent over the serial port into memory. The
<base-address> parameter is not usually required as it is worked out
automatically (it specifies the lowest address in the S-record stream).

*note*

	Because of the way memory is allocated by the S-record loader it probably
	won't be possible to boot an uncompressed kernel downloaded over the serial
	port. A compressed kernel should however work.

flash [address size] target
---------------------------

!!  WARNING: THIS COMMAND CAN MAKE YOUR UNIT UNBOOTABLE  !!

Programs either the current image in memory or the memory block specified by
<address> and <size> into the Flash starting at address <target>. The target
address can be specified either as a memory address or an offset from the
start of the Flash (ie 'flash 0' and 'flash 1fc00000' are equivalent).

keymap [keymap]
---------------

Used with no arguments this command lists the available keymaps, otherwise the
keymap is changed to <keymap>.

read[{.b|.h|.w}] [address]
--------------------------

Read and display the value of the memory location <address>. If no address is
specified the next address will be read.

A .b/.h/.w suffix can be used to specify the size of the value as byte/half
word/word respectively.

write[{.b|.h|.w}] [address] data
--------------------------------

Write the specified value into the memory location <address>. If no address is
specified the next address will be written.

A .b/.h/.w suffix can be used to specify the size of the value as byte/half
word/word respectively.

dump[{.b|.h|.w}] [address [count]]
----------------------------------

Display <count> values from memory, starting with the specified address. If
no address is specified the next address will be used. If no count is
specified the last count will be used (the default count is the number of
values that make up 256 bytes).

A .b/.h/.w suffix can be used to specify the size of the value as byte/half
word/word respectively.

help
----

List available commands and their usage.

nvflags [number ...]
--------------------

Toggles the specified configuration flags and then lists state of all the
debug flags.  Active flags are marked with a '*', inactive ones with a '.'.

The flags currently defined are

	0 - disable IDE drivers use of LBA (ie force CHS).
	1 - disable IDE drivers use of LBA48 (ie force 24-bit LBA).
	2 - disable IDE timing change (by default the IDE driver will set the IDE
	    interface timing to PIO mode 4 timings if the drive(s) supports PIO mode
		 4, this flag will leave the timings set at their default, slow, values).
	3 - enable IDE slave detection. Normally the boot loader does not bother
	    checking for the prescence of an IDE slave device. This flag must be
		 set before the first 'mount' command for slave detection to work.

net [{address netmask [gateway]} | down]
----------------------------------------

Configures the primary network interface with the specified IP address, subnet
mask and (optionally) router address.

A single argument of 'down' causes the network interface to be shutdown.

If no arguments are passed the interface is configured by requesting
configuration information from a DHCP server on the local network.

*note*

	IP address and netmask can be specified together by using the
	<address>/<network bits> form eg. 192.168.1.0/24.

tftp host path [path]
---------------------

Load the file from the specified host into memory using TFTP. An optional
second file can be specified that will also be loaded and used as an 'initrd'
image.

ping host
---------

Sends ICMP echo request packets to the specified host and displays information
from received replies. Pressing the CTRL-C or the SPACE key terminates the
command.

pci[{.b|.h|.w}] [device[.function] register [value]]
----------------------------------------------------

Read or write PCI config space register. A .b/.h/.w suffix can be used to
specify the size of the register as byte/half word/word respectively. The
register address must be correctly aligned for the size of the operation.

If no arguments are passed the PCI bus is scanned and the PCI ID of each
device found is displayed.

boot [list | default] [option]
------------------------------

Boots the system using the specified script. If no option number is given the
default boot script is used. If the option number 0 is used the boot menu is
run.

If the first argument is the word "list" the command lists all available boot
scripts or the actual script that will be executed for the given option
number.

If the first argument is the word "default" then the specified option is set
as the default boot script.

variable [name [value]]
-----------------------

Set or delete a variable. If no value is specified the named variable is
deleted.

If called with no arguments all variables are listed with their values.
