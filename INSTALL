THE EASY ALTERNATIVE
====================

Rather than blowing the replacement boot loader into Flash, it is also
possible to use the original Cobalt boot loader to load the replacement boot
loader - chain mode. This does away with the risk of trashing your unit,
though it extends the time required to boot.

Just copy 'chain.bin' to your boot directory, rename into 'vmlinux' and gzip
it to 'vmlinux.gz'

	cp -f /boot/vmlinux.gz /boot/backup.gz
	cp chain.bin /boot/vmlinux
	gzip -9 /boot/vmlinux
	reboot

If booting fails you'll need to boot using the backup kernel.

Step 1 - safety check
---------------------

You must be running a recent 2.4.x kernel for the Flash programming tool to
work (2.4.18 or newer).

Check that the boot loader works in chain mode (see "The Easy Alternative"
above).

Check that the Flash chip on your unit is socketed. Don't proceed unless this
is the case (unless you're a skilled solderer).

Step 2 - saving the old boot loader
-----------------------------------

Take a copy of the original boot loader

	flash-tool cobalt-original-boot.bin

This should create a file called 'cobalt-original-boot.bin' that is 512KB in
size.

	!!  SAVE THIS FILE SOMEWHERE VERY SAFE  !!
	
Save the file somewhere safe, not on your Qube/RaQ. You will need this file to
restore your unit to it's original state.

Step 3 - check disk partition table
-----------------------------------

The new boot loader will attempt to load '/boot/vmlinux.gz' from the boot
partition on the disk. If no partition is marked as bootable, or if the boot
partition is not a Linux partition, it will attempt to boot from the first
Linux partition it finds in the partition table. Booting will fail if the
selected partition does not contain an EXT2/3 file system.

You can ensure the correct partition is booted by using 'fdisk' to mark your
boot partition bootable.

Step 4 - install the new boot loader
------------------------------------

Write the new boot loader into the Flash. Don't interrupt the programming
process or you will probably land up with a unit that doesn't boot!

	flash-tool -w colo-rom-image.bin

If for any reason programming fails you might just be able to write the
original boot loader back into the Flash

	flash-tool -w cobalt-original-boot.bin

Step 5 - moment of truth
------------------------

Cross your fingers and reboot.

PROBLEMS
--------

If for some reason the boot loader runs okay but you can't get it to boot a
kernel from disk it is possible to boot a compressed kernel loaded over the
serial port (S-record format) using the boot loader shell. It is also possible
to restore the original boot loader from the shell (either by loading the
original boot loader code from disk or by transferring it to the boot loader
shell as an S-record file). See the files README.shell and README.restore for
information on the boot loader shell.
