CoLo 1.21 (xxxx-xx-xx)
----------------------

*	Merged "screen" and "minicom" keymaps.

*	Added delete word to line editor ('ctrl-w').

CoLo 1.20 (2006-01-16)
----------------------

*	Fix menu cancel/abort/error returns.

*	Update NV format to include keymap.

*	Added keymap for "screen".

*	Wait for network interface transmit ring to drain when disabling network
	interface. This should improve net console output.

*	Added header file dependency checking to stage1, stage2 and chain.

CoLo 1.19 (2005-04-03)
----------------------

*	Fixed stupid bug in ordering of LCD initialisation. This would cause
	installs of 1.17 or 1.18 which weren't an upgrade from 1.16 to crash
	early in stage2.

*	Added "README.tools" to tools directory.

*	Renamed 'md5rom' to 'copy-rom' and added the ability to save a copy of the
	ROM to a file.

*	Moved PCI timeout / retry counter initialisation to PCI initialisation
	code. We now use a retry count of 255 rather than retrying forever. The
	kernel needs a similiar fix.

*	Improved PCI bus scan.

CoLo 1.18 (2005-03-22)
----------------------

*	Added UDP network console support. This adds a 'netcon' command and
	associated variables, and a new boot menu item "Network Shell".

*	Added "ncon" to tools directory. Very simple net console client.

*	PCI serial support switch moved to NV flag 7.

CoLo 1.17 (2005-02-20)
----------------------

*	DHCP client now broadcasts DHCPREQUEST packets. It also includes the
	"server identifier" option from the server in the request. Fixed bug where
	we weren't appending an "end options" tag to the options. [RFC2131]

*	Dropped "no matching socket" diagnostic message.

*	Simplified display of memory size on boot.

*	Added "Cancel" option to 'paneld' menus.

*	Added horizontal scrolling menus to 'paneld' (Controlled by the '-h'
	option).

*	Added horizontal scrolling menus to shell. Controlled by an NV flag (see
	'nvflags' command in README.shell).

*	Reset menu timeout when a button is pressed.

*	Removed ARP diagnostic messages.

CoLo 1.16 (2004-12-16)
----------------------

*	Force menu choice of console on/off on upgrade from earlier versions.

*	Fix 'flash-tool' and 'flash' command to work with TMS29F040 Flash.

CoLo 1.15 (2004-11-28)
----------------------

*	Added link detection to network driver.

*	Added support for 21041 network controller (2700WG units).

*	Added clock speed detection (stage2 only) to ensure timeouts and delays are
	consistent regardless of CPU speed.

*	Added new command 'sleep'.

CoLo 1.14 (2004-10-26)
----------------------

*	Cleaned up build system and added cross compile support.
	[cross compile suggestion / gcc-3.4 link fix - Sebastien Vajda]
	[compiler flag suggestions - Thiemo Seufer]

*	Added new example boot script 'menu.colo' showing new features.

*	Variable expansion in the shell is now carried out before argument
	splitting.  This means variables can now span arguments e.g.

		var message "'first' 'second'"
		lcd {message}

*	Reworked the LCD menu command. The 'menu' command has been removed and
	replaced with a new command, 'select'. The new command justs sets a
	variable to the index of the selected item which can then be used with
	'goto'.

*	Added 'noop' command, which does nothing. When combined with the 'onfail'
	command it can be used for checking the existence of variables.

*	Added script commands 'goto', 'onfail', 'exit' and 'abort'.

*	Added positional marks in scripts using the '@' character.

*	Scripts can now be nested.

*	The 'console-speed' variable is now only available when the serial port is
	enabled.

*	Fixed up support for booting 64-bit kernels (32-bit support was reorganised
	too). 32-bit kernels must be linked for KSEG0 or KSEG1, 64-bit kernels for
	CKSEG0, CKSEG1 or XKPHYS.

*	Ensure we read from Galileo PCI RETRY/TIMEOUT register before writing to
	it. A comment in the kernel source indicates this might be necessary to
	stop Galileo locking up on early units.

*	Added a '-n' command line option to 'putlcd' which allows the user to write
	to a single line of the LCD without affecting the other line.

*	Added big fat warning to 'flash-tool' (just in case).

CoLo 1.13 (2004-08-30)
----------------------

*	Speeded up raw LCD access in LCD tools library.

*	Added 'on' and 'off' options to the 'serial' command.

*	Added 'colo-perm' and 'md5rom' to build.

*	Added missing include to paneld.c.

CoLo 1.12 (2004-08-20)
----------------------

*	The LCD tools 'putlcd', 'paneld' and 'e2fsck-lcd' are now built around a
	common library. The library has support for using direct access to the LCD
	via /dev/mem (the default) or driver access via the Cobalt LCD driver.

	To make the library use the Cobalt LCD driver you need to export an
	environment variable LCD_DEVICE with the name of the device. If LCD_DEVICE
	is an empty string the library will use the default device name, /dev/lcd.

*	Added a '-d' command line option to 'paneld' which makes it fork itself
	into the background on startup.

*	Added 'menu' boot shell command for implementing LCD menus in scripts.
	This feature makes it possible to choose from a list of multiple
	kernels/configurations to boot (see example in README.shell).

*	Fixed a couple of off by one errors in the 'boot' command.

*	Added 'console disable' to the non-volatile flags. This defers initialising
	the serial port until the boot shell is entered and should make it possible
	to use CoLo on units which don't have a serial port. This flag will be set
	by default on new installs, but will be clear on units which have a recent
	CoLo install already. Might also be useful where the serial port is used
	for a modem etc.

*	Added man pages for 'paneld' and 'e2fsck-lcd'.
	[Martin Michlmayr]

CoLo 1.11 (2004-07-28)
----------------------

*	Build all the tools.

*	You can now break out of the boot menu via the console.

*	Added man pages for 'colo-perm' and 'md5rom'.
	[Martin Michlmayr]

*	Added 'e2fsck-lcd', file check progress bar on LCD.

*	Fixed LCD second row offset (all over).

*	Make shell refuse to load chain loader.

*	Added simple front panel daemon 'paneld'.

*	Added 'restrict' command to shell.

CoLo 1.10 (2004-05-23)
----------------------

*	Fixed loading of files with sparse blocks.

*	Added signature to Flash, and 'colo-perm' to test for it.

*	Changed PCI latency registers to 64 (matches kernel default).

*	Added NFS support ('nfs' command).

*	Removed debugging output from chain loader. Chain loader now uses LCD for
 	error messages.

*	Added command 'serial' for changing serial baud rate. Baud rate setting is
	non-volatile.

CoLo 1.9 (2004-05-02)
---------------------

*	CTRL-C now acts as a break key (in addition to SPACE).

*	Comments are now only supported in scripts.

*	The 'script' command has been changed to execute a script already loaded
 	into memory via the 'load', 'tftp' or 'download' commands.

	** NOTE **

		Scripts must now begin with the line '#:CoLo:#'.

*	Automatic insertion of the kernel 'initrd=' command line argument has been
 	removed. All initrd parameters are now available in variables.

*	Made use of non-volatile storage on RTC.

*	Renamed 'dflags' command to 'nvflags' and made the flags non-volatile.

*	Added boot menu and 'boot' command.

	*note*

		If you do not want the boot menu to appear every boot use the command
		'boot default 1' (see README.shell).

*	Added 'variable' command.

*	Implemented variable substition in shell command lines.

*	DHCP now sets variables with boot information.

*	Added 'lcd' command.

CoLo 1.8 (2004-04-26)
---------------------

*	Added 'pci' command.

*	Added 'ping' command.

*	Added 'tftp' command.

*	Added network stack (the 'net' command).

*	Added man pages for 'flash-tool' and 'putlcd'.
	[Martin Michlmayr]

CoLo 1.6 (2004-04-18)
---------------------

*	Added support for RAID partitions.
	[Christian Mock]

*	The layout of the source tree has been tidied up.

*	Stage 2 is now loaded at the top of RAM rather than the bottom. We can now
	load kernels linked to run at 0x80000000. This is a big change, but it all
	seems to work.

	Unfortunately the chain loader can no longer detect if it's being loaded
	from "CoLo".

*	Build output files are now 'colo-rom-image.bin' and 'colo-chain.elf'.

*	Boot loader now sources the script '/boot/default.colo' by default, rather
	than '/boot/default.boot'.

*	Fixed stupid error in linking of chain loader.

CoLo 1.5 (2004-04-11)
---------------------

*	The boot loader now has a name, "CoLo".
	[suggested by Kumba]

*	Added support for loading initial RamDisk. A second path passed to the
	'load' command is interpreted as a file to be loaded as an initial RamDisk.
	The 2004-04-11 2.4.x kernel patch includes the kernel side of this
	functionality.
	[suggested by Martin Michlmayr]

*	The chain loader now halts with an error message if it's loaded from "CoLo"
	rather than from the original Cobalt loader.
