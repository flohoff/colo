CoLo 1.5 (2004-04-11)
---------------------

*	The boot loader now has a name, "CoLo".
	[suggested by Kumba]

*	Added support for loading initial RamDisk. A second path passed to the
	'load' command is interpreted as a file to be loaded as an initial RamDisk.
	The 2004-04-11 2.4.x kernel patch includes the kernel side of this
	functionality.
	[suggested by Martin Michlmayr]

*	The chain loader now halts with an error message if it's loaded from "CoLo"
	rather than from the original Cobalt loader.
