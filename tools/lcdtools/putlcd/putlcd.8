.TH PUTLCD 8 "April 2004"

.SH NAME
putlcd \- display text on Cobalt's LCD display

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B putlcd
[\fI-n\fR] [\fISTRING\fR] [\fISTRING\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B putlcd
is a tool to display text on the LCD display of Cobalt machines.  Since
the LCD display features two lines of 16 characters,
.B putlcd
accepts two strings as its argument, representing the first and the second
line.  If any of the two arguments are omitted, the empty string is
assumed and that line of the LCD will be cleared.  If you want to display
text containing white space, you have to properly quote the text, otherwise
.B putlcd
will interpret the text as separate arguments.

If
.B putlcd
is run with the \fI-n\fR switch the LCD line will not be cleared if the
corresponding string is empty.

.SH EXAMPLES

Put "Hello" on the first line and "world" on the second:
.RS
.ft CW
putlcd Hello world
.ft R
.RE
.PP

Put "Hello world" on the first line and clear the second:
.RS
.ft CW
putlcd "Hello world"
.ft R
.RE
.PP

Put "Hello world" on the second line and clear the first:
.RS
.ft CW
putlcd "" "Hello world"
.ft R
.RE
.PP

Clear the whole display:
.RS
.ft CW
putlcd "" ""
.ft R

or simply:
