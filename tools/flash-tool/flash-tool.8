.TH FLASH-TOOL 8 "April 2004"

.SH NAME
flash-tool \- read or write Cobalt's flash

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B flash-tool
[\fI-w\fR] [\fI-o offset\fR] [\fI-f\fR] \fIfile\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B flash-tool
can be used to read the current content of Cobalt's flash and write it to a
file, or to reprogram the flash with an image supplied by the user.
.B flash-tool
can therefore be used to first create a backup of Cobalt's original boot
loader and then reprogram the flash with a tested image of colo,
a replacement boot loader for Cobalt which offers more features than the
original boot loader.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-w\fR
Reprogram the flash with the specified image rather than read the current
flash to the specified image (which is the default).

.TP
\fB\-o offset\fR
Specify a specific location of the image as the start.

.SH EXAMPLES

Take a copy of the original boot loader (or whatever your flash currently
contains):
.RS
.ft CW
flash-tool cobalt-original-boot.bin
.ft R
.RE
.PP

Reprogram your flash with another image (see the warning below):
.RS
.ft CW
flash-tool -w rom-image.bin
.ft R
.RE
.PP

.SH WARNING
.PP

Writing a new image to the flash of your Cobalt machine involves
reprogramming the flash.  Do not interrupt the programming process or you
will probably land up with a unit that doesn't boot!  Furthermore, make
sure that the image you write to your flash actually works.  If the
reprogramming fails, you will have to remove and reprogram the flash chip
with an external programmer.  This might mean desoldering the chip as well
as finding a suitable programmer.  Only use the reprogramming functionality
of
.B flash-tool
with caution and if you know what you are doing.

.SH SEE ALSO
.PP

current flash and reprogram it with colo can be found at

.SH FILES

.IR /usr/lib/colo/rom-image.bin
- flashable ROM image of colo
