CoLo NETWORK CONSOLE
====================

As of version 1.18, CoLo supports a rudimentary network console.

The network console is started with the command 'netcon' or through the boot
menu item "Network Shell".

When "Network Shell" is chosen from the boot menu the unit first queries a
DHCP server for an IP address etc. and also for the address of the next server
to be used in the boot process. A network console session is then started to
the next server, using the source port 6665 and the destination port 6666.

If the network console is started from the boot shell using the 'netcon'
command the host, destination port and source port can be specified directly.

There is not a protocol as such. The exchanged UDP packets just contain simple
ASCII text.

In the 'tools/ncon' directory of the CoLo source there is a very simple client
application. The client application should be started on the server, passing
the hostname or IP address of the target unit.

CoLo's net console is roughly compatible with the kernel net console. See the
'netcon' entry in README.shell for an example of how to propagate the network
console settings to the kernel.

*NOTE*

The network console is totally independent of the serial console. Both can
operate at the same time if required.
