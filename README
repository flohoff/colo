REPLACEMENT COBALT Qube2/RaQ2 BOOT LOADER
=========================================

See the file INSTALL for installation instructions.

FEATURES
--------

* Will boot from any primary Linux partition containing an EXT2/3 file
  system. The boot file system is no longer required to be a formatted as an
  EXT2 revision 0 file system. Will also boot from a whole device.

* The maximum size of kernel that can be booted is only constrained by
  available memory. A 16MB unit will be able to boot a 7MB uncompressed
  kernel (the limit is less for a compressed kernel, probably around 5MB).

* Support for booting from EXT2 formatted CDROMs.

* Support for network booting via TFTP or NFS with DHCP.

* Provides an LCD boot menu (hold the "ENTER" and "SELECT" buttons whilst
  booting the unit).

LIMITATIONS
-----------

* The boot loader currently unconditionally outputs boot messages over the
  serial port. This would probably upset attached modems etc.

* Will not currently boot from logical (extended) partitions.

* Network booting over NFS has not been checked to see whether it works with
  the original restore CD (I don't have a suitable network card). To test this
  CoLo would have to be resident in Flash, so it's only for the brave and
  fearless.
